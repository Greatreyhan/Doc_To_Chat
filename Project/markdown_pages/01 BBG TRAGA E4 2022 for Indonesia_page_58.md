MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
・Connecting connectors
- Securely hold both connectors (male and 
female) and check whether the connector pins 
and the cavities match. Also, check whether the 
connectors are aligned. 
- Securely hold the connectors and carefully 
engage them by pushing until the connectors 
click.
・Checking connectors
- When using circuit tester to test conduction of 
connector, insert test probes of circuit tester 
from harness side of the connector.
- For the water proof connector, the test probes 
cannot be inserted from the harness side 
structurally. Use testing connector prepared 
beforehand to check. Connect test connector to 
the vehicle side connector and connect test 
probes to the harness of the testing connector.
- Do not insert test probes to protection rubber of 
water proof connector. It may decrease the 
water proof performance and became cause of 
corrosion.
