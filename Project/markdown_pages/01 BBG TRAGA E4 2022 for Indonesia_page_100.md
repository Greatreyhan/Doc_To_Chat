ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
① ACG output characteristics
The following table shows the ACG working voltage and specifications, and the figure shows
ACG output characteristics diagram installed on the shipping vehicle model. The ACG output
increases as the engine speed increases, so use to find the ACG output in the engine speed
range where the vehicle is supposed to be used.
5-2 WORKING VOLTAGEAND OUTPUT CHARACTERISTICS OF ACG
・Precaution
- Do not continue to use the electrical current with the total electrical load of the chassis and
additional equipment exceeding the ACG output. It may cause the battery exhaustion.
- Due to the output characteristics of ACG, the output of ACG also decreases when the
engine speed is low. Make sure that the electrical load of the rear body or additional
equipment at idling speed does not exceed the ACG output. Also, if it is necessary to use
the rear body or additional equipment at the idling speed, take measures such as
increasing the idling speed.
