GENERAL  
When designing and examining body, consider regulation control in use country and agreement to
standard, and safety and prevention of accidents of vehicle, and follow instructions below.
2-1 PRECAUTIONS FOR INSTALLING BODY
・Design the rear body to evenly distribute the load of rear body on chassis frame.
-Installation of special equipments on a chassis frame can change the said load distribution.
Therefore, such special equipments must be installed, taking load distribution into account,
otherwise stress concentration in particular part of the chassis frame may occur, possibly
resulting in cracks in chassis frame members or other problems even if the total weight of
these special equipments falls within allowable range. Confirm that there is no problem in
safety in chassis frame member before the examination.
① Weight of body
・If there is any equipment addition (e.g. fuel tank addition) or weight trend to one side (e.g.
side door installation of the van body), adjust right and left weight difference on rear body.
② Approach angle, departure angle, and ramp angle.
・When adding equipments on front overhang, rear overhang or lower part between axles, note
that the approach angle, departure angle, and ramp angle do not go below the position of
existing equipments.
