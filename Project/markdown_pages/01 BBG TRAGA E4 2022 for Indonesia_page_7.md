PRINCIPAL SPECIFICATIONS OF VARIOUS VEHICLE MODELS  
 WB:  Wheelbase (mm)…Refer to “1-7 CAB CHASSIS DRAWINGS "    
 OS:  Offset of the combined center of gravity of the rear body and cargo  
  from the rear axle center (mm) 
 CP:  Distance from occupant to the rear axle center (mm)  
     CPa:  Distance from occupant to the front axle center (mm)  
 L/2:  Half length of the cargo bed (mm) 
 BW:  Rear body weight (kg)  
 PL:  Cargo weight (kg) 
 CW:  Occupants weight (kg) 
 CAWf: Chassis front axle weight (kg)       
 CAWr: Chassis rear axle weight (kg) 
 GAWf: Vehicle front axle weight (kg) 
 GAWr: Vehicle rear axle weight (kg) 
 GVW: Gross vehicle weight (kg)  
 Basic formula  
 (a) GVW  =GAWf+GAWr 
  =CAWf+CAWr+BW+PL+CW 
 (b) GAWf =CAWf+{(BW+PL)xOS/WB}+(CWxCP/WB) 
                     =CAWf+{(BW+PL)xOS/WB}+{CWx(WB-CPa)/WB} 
 (c) GAWr =GVW-GAWf

1-3 WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION 
① Formula for determining load distribution (2 axle vehicle・single cab) 
  The assumption condition of this calculating formula is as follows.  
 ・ Assume that the center of gravity of the total weight of the rear body and cargo is located in 
the center of the overall length of the rear body.
