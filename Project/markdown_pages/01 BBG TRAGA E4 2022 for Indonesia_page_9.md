PRINCIPAL SPECIFICATIONS OF VARIOUS VEHICLE MODELS 
Z = Y+(Yâˆ’ X)L2/L1
X = HF+TF
Y = HR+TR
X: Ground height of chassis frame top surface above front axle (mm)
Y: Ground height of chassis frame top surface above rear axle (mm)
Z: Ground height of chassis frame rear end (mm)
WF: Front axle load (kg)
WR:Rear axle load (kg)
L1: Wheelbase (mm)
L2: Chassis frame rear overhang (mm)
TF: Front tire radius (when loaded) (mm)
TR: Rear tire radius (when loaded) (mm)
HF: Distance from chassis frame top surface above front axle to wheel center (mm)
HR: Distance from chassis frame top surface above rear axle to wheel center (mm)
