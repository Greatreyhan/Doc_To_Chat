MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
There is a possibility that the 
terminal and connector are 
disconnected in vibration. Fix 
the harness in the proper 
location.
Poor example
Good example
・Moving harness
- When connecting an additional harness to any equipment that produces relative vibration
against chassis frame, such as engine and transmission, reasonably slacken the harness
and lay it along the factory-installed harnesses so as to absorb the relative vibration. Be
sure that the additional harness does not contact with adjacent parts or equipments.
- As for the factory-installed harnesses connected to the equipments that produce relative
vibration against chassis frame, such as engine and transmission, do not change the way
how they are secured, the clipping points, and the sagging volume.
・Heat protection
- Harnesses must sufficiently be distant from heat source (e.g. Exhaust pipe). Be sure that
the temperature of the harnesses does not exceed their allowable temperature limit (80°C
in principle).
・Clip
- Use plastic clips, or vinyl-coated or rubber-coated plate clips whose base material is rust-
proofed.
- Clip distance are as follows:
Harness diameter Clip distance
5 or less 300 or less
5 to 10 400 or less
10 or more 500 or less
A variety of clips

- If the wire vibrate due to engine or driving vibration, shorten the clipping distances.
