MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
⑨ Harness routing
・When laying additional wires, be sure that they will not restrict inspection or maintenance of
the vehicle components.
・To increase reliability of wires, protect all additional wires and harnesses with corrugated
tubes or polyvinyl chloride tubes.
・When handling the wires, do not pull them hard.
・Additional harnesses should be laid along and secured on rear body members or on chassis
frame. Do not pass them in the air.
・Securely fix the harnesses in place so that they will not contact with moving parts or sharp
objects.
・Fix the harnesses so there is no jamming at rear body mounting.
・If there is possibility that a harness contacts with a sharp edge of a metal part, protect the
harness with corrugated tubes and clip fix to avoid contact the sharp edge, or cover the sharp
edge with a protector, otherwise vibration will damage the harness coating.
Object Required distance between harness and object
Moving part most approached 10mm or more
Sharp object minimum distance 10mm or more
