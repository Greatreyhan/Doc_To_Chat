・When re-attaching components after completion of painting, follow the instructions below and
be sure to re-attach them.
- Re-attach the components after the paint completely hardens.
- For the scratches that can be made during unfastening and fastening screws, bolts, or
nuts, touch them up with a brush soaked in clear lacquer, etc.
- When re-attaching removed mirror, be sure to tighten the bolt with appropriate torque.
- For the components installed with the bolt with the adhesive, do not reuse the bolts
because it causes slacking.
・The United States’ Ziebart’s rust-proofing agent is globally popular in protection from road
snow melting agent, salty wind, etc. Apply this Ziebart’s rust-proofing agent on cab under floor
area, inner sides of fenders, outer side of a front panel, lower parts of doors, and joints of
panels. Follow the instructions below.
④ Rust prevention with Ziebart’s
- Before applying the agent, cover the drain holes in the doors and in other areas with tape
in order to prevent them from being plugged up with the agent. Also cover the air bleeding
holes in air valves, etc. with tape to protect them from blockage.
- After completion of the agent application, remove the tapes and check the drain holes for
blockage. Since a cab is made from thin steel plates, if the drain holes are plugged up by
something such as rust-proofing agent, water or salty water may consequently rust the
panels, in the worst case making holes in them or weakening the strength of the members
that are assuring the strength of the cab.
