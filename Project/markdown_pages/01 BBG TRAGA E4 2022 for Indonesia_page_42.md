MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
④ Precautions for connecting pipes
・Do not connect two or more hoses to lengthen a single hose.
・Fabricate a connecting pipe from a steel pipe. Perform bulge forming or spool forming on both
ends of this pipe.
・If bulge forming and spool forming are impossible, the insertion depth should be 35mm or
more.
・Secure the hoses on a chassis frame or something else by using clips.
・Insert this connecting pipe into hoses by more than 30mm, and secure with clips.
・Hose joints must not be located above an exhaust system.
・After completing the hose connection, confirm that there is no fuel leakage.
・Do not join a fuel hose to the factory-installed one to take out fuel. Fuel must be taken out
directly from the fuel tank.
