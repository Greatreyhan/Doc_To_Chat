Chapter 3
MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
・Do not splice in the following area; bent location of harness, area of large vibration, and area
of high temperature.
- Since the flexibility is reduced at splicing portion as compared with other portions, it is
possible that harness route may not return to the original.
- Possibility of disconnection occurrence will be higher, because flutter increases due to
larger weight.
- Decide the position of the splice carefully
・In case of performing the splicing in the middle of the connecting route to the relative motion
part (cab to frame, engine/mission to frame), there is a risk of breakage caused by bending
input. Perform the splicing out of the connection area by replacing the lengthened wire all
spans the area.
