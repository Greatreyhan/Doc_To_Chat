・GAW is the lightest load capacity determined by comparing the axle load capacity and the tire
load capacity.
・The cab chassis weight depends on the following conditions.
- The weight includes specified amount of fluid (fuel, coolant, oil), spare tire and required
tools.
・The cab chassis weight listed above may be different from the actual weight of each vehicle
specification. Measure the weight before conducting rear body mounting, if required.
・Tire load capacity comply with ETRTO (The European Tyre and Rim Technical Organisation).
・The front tire air pressure is set to 300kPa by ISUZU MOTORS, which is different from the
standard air pressure of ETRTO (450kPa). ( )* is the value of tire load capacity at the setting
tire air pressure in ISUZU MOTORS.
