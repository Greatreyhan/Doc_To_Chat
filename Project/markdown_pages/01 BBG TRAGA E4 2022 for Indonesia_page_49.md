MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
④ Wire size and fuse capacity
・Improper use of wire harnesses may result in fire or equipment breakdown.
・If additional wire harnesses are required, select appropriate wires according to the load
current to be added, the circuit length, and the harness route.
・Use electric wires for automobiles (JIS-certified wires such as AV, AVS, AVX, AEX, or
equivalent).
・When using an AEX wire, parts used with it such as protection tube, corrugated tube, vinyl
tape, etc. should also be heat-proofed.
・When using a wire whose size is 5mm2 or larger, solder the pressured part inside the wire
terminal to prevent it from heating.
・Fuse capacity, wire size and circuit length
- Fuse capacity on the power source side determines usable wire size and circuit length.
- Select appropriate wire size in consideration of the fuse capacity on the power source side
and the wire route. If a wire is connected to an equipment that produces relative
movement, the size of the wire should be 0.85mm2 or larger so as to prevent wire breaking.
