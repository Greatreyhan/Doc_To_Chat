MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
・When the connector or the wire close to connector is damaged, prepare connector ASM for
replenishment and perform splicing.
- Below figure shows joint terminal method. Follow the same procedure for solder or
crimped-type terminal method.
- When using specific joint terminal for splicing, the length of wire cutoff and connector ASM
for replenishment must be the same (L mm).
- When splicing with soldering or using crimping terminal, length of the additional wire must
be the total of length of connector ASM and overlap of joint potion added. If there is
recommended length for used crimping terminal, add the overlap length to it.
Splicing wires close to connector (joint terminal method)
・Additional wires and connector ASM for replenishment must be the same size (diameter of
copper wire). Considering re-repairing, use of same color wire is recommended.
・When splicing 4 or more wires, adjust splice position by shifting back and forth to avoid
overlapping to keep the harness diameter enlargement in minimum. Do the above same with
3 or less, if they do not fit in the protective material with splicing at the same position.
