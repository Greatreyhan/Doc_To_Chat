MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
・Dry type (decals with cut characters or stripes)
- Same way with the sheet decal.
By putting half pulling out slit in the released paper beforehand, it becomes easier to
temporary fix the decal. Moreover, note that loosening is not caused in the decal when it
puts on pressure by the squeegee enough when it is long. Press and stick the loosen
decal, wrinkle and the bubble may occur.
・Dry type (fitting on corner area)
- Cut or roll it inside. Make it 1mm shorter from the corner when cutting, or bend it 10mm or
more when rolling it in, and press it heating with dryer.

How to affix decal (at corner)
・Dry type (fitting on uneven part)
- Press-fit concave part by using the edge of the squeegee. Please move right and left and
work about the squeegee. Note that the decal does not loosen.
- Press- fit toward next concave part by the squeegee. Note that the decal does not stretch.
- Press-fit the convex part by using the squeegee as shown in figure. Press enough so that
the squeegee deforms.
- Fitting on a globular uneven part is impossible.
- Without removing a release paper, temporarily place the decal in position, and mark the
position with tape.
- Peel off the release paper from the edge approximately 20mm, and then fold down the
paper 180°.
- Align to the positioning tape, press and paste up the 20mm area with squeegee first.
Temporarily fix the other edges with tape so that the decal will not move.
- Slowly peel off the release paper, and press the decal carefully.
- Basically , move the squeegee in same direction, downward or right to left.
- When you are sure with no meandering or mis-positioning, remove the positioning tapes.
- If there are bubbles trapped inside the decal, pop it with needle and press them out to
flatten.
- Press the entire surface hard for the last time, and then carefully remove the paper carrier
tape in 180° angle.
