・Confirm the material of bonding surface. There is possibility that the decals may not stick at
all or may come off shortly after being affixed on following materials.
- Low polarity plastic such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and teflon
- Rough surfaces such as cloth, whetstone, sandpapers, and plastic emboss finished goods
- When a mold lubricant, a plasticizer, and other additives to the surface of the plastic
molding.
- Hygroscopicity plastic such as ABS, noryl, and urethanes
・Remove wax if the wax has adhered.
・If there is any extraneous substance on a bonding surface (cab, panel) such as water, oil and
dust, decals will not firmly stick to the surface. If there is any, wipe them off completely with a
clean cloth soaked in IPA (isopropyl alcohol). If the substance cannot be removed, completely
wipe it off with lacquer thinner, etc., and then wipe the surface again with IPA.
