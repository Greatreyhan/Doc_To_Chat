⑧ Connectors
・Use water-proof connectors for the harnesses placed outside a cab.
・Do not unnecessarily disconnect these waterproof connectors, otherwise continuity failure will
occur.
・When disconnecting waterproof connectors, to prevent foreign substances such as water and
metal chips from getting into the joint, or to protect the sealed part from being damaged, cover
the disconnected connectors with vinyl bags or something. If water or any foreign substance
get into the joint, dry up the joint or remove such foreign substance before connecting the
connectors.
・As for the area where connectors may be subjected to vibration, use connectors with a
detach-safe lock.
・When using a “GIBOSHI” type plug, be sure that its socket connector (female) with insulation
cover is connected to the wire from the power source, to prevent it from shorting when the
plug comes off and contacts with vehicle body.
・Disconnecting connectors
- Certain types of connectors have a tang lock that prevents these connectors from coming
off when vehicle is running.
- Some tang locks can be released by pulling (①) while the others by pushing in (②).
Check which type of tang lock the connectors have.
- To prevent harnesses from coming off from the connector or breaking, when disconnecting
connectors, do not pull the harnesses but securely hold both connectors (male and female),
release the tang lock, and then separate the connectors with care.
