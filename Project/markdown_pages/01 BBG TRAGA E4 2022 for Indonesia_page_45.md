MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
・Careless modification may result in fire or equipment breakdown. Follow the below cautions.
3-6 PRECAUTIONS FOR MODIFICATION OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
- Modification to the factory-installed electrical components such as wires, fuses and relays
are prohibited.
- Do not tear protective corrugated tubes and pull out inside wires to connect additional
equipments because this may damage the remaining harnesses.
- Be careful not to damage the wire harness and other components. When they are
damaged, have, them repaired.
- Never modify the harness around electric unit (control unit).
- Restore the terminals, connectors, clips, and harnesses removed at work where they were
originally. If the terminal polarity or connector partner is confused, it may lead to defect or
damage the component.
- If the original clip cannot be used due to additional components, add alternative clip to fix
harness.
- When a clip for fixing harness is broken, replace it with new clip same as the broken one.
Metallic clip has coating (rubber or vinyl chloride) at harness converging part. Clip with tear
on coating, hole, crack is considered damaged, and replace it with new clip.
- Exposing connectors, relay box, and electric equipments to such water may cause water
intrusion into electric components or internal condensation, resulting in problems such as
operational malfunction, erosion, and in the worst case, a vehicle fire.
- When mounting rear body on chassis frame, be careful not to have harness jammed.
- When there is melting fuse, investigate the cause, repair it, and change it with new one of
specified capacity. Never increase the fuse capacity, it will burnout components and wires,
and lead to fire.
② Additional power supply (standby power supply) and ground circuit
Sizes and shapes of terminals and electric wires used for the increase must use the one that
corresponded to the increased load. Select the battery and ACG that corresponds to the
electric load when installing body with high electric load. Refer to "1-1 PRINCIPAL
SPECIFICATIONS OF THE CAB CHASSIS" for specification of each equipment.
