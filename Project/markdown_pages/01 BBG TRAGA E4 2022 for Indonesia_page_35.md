Chapter 3
MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
If a rear body constrains a sub frame to necessarily protrude outward from the rear end of a
chassis frame by 300mm or more, lengthen rear overhang of the chassis frame according to need.
If it is absolutely necessary to cut a side member of a chassis frame for modification, make sure
that the cut line does not split existing holes.
3-3 MODIFYING REAR OVERHANG OF A CHASSIS FRAME
① Extension material
・The extension material, thickness and bending radius of the extension should be equivalent
to that of side members. Refer to " 1-11 FRAME SECTION MODULUS".
② Installing extension material
・In case that extension material is 300mm or shorter
- Join an extension material and a chassis frame by continuous butt welding on the entire
circumference. After welding, grind finish weld surface.
