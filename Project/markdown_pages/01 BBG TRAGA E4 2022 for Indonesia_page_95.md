REAR BODY MOUNTING 
Bending radius of U-bolt and spacer installation
・Welding the reinforcement or U-bolts to frame is prohibited (include tack weld).
・The installation direction of U-bolts should be either downward or upward.
・It is recommended to use steel reinforcement for the area near exhaust system components.
If wooden reinforcement are preferable, be sure to provide a sufficient clearance between a
wooden block and an exhaust system component.
・If any pipe or harness is located near the reinforcement or U-bolts, maintain a minimum of
10mm clearance between the reinforcement or U-bolts and fixed part or unmoving part of
such pipe or harness, and a minimum of 40mm between the reinforcement or U-bolts and
moving part of the pipe or the harness.
・U-bolts should be parallel to the side member flange.
- Use U-bolts with bending radius smaller then that of chassis frame side member.
- Insert a spacer as shown below if a U-bolt with bending radius smaller than that of chassis 
frame side member is difficult to obtain.
