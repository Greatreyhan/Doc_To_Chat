Chapter 3
MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
・To prevent harness coating from being damaged, attach grommets to the through holes in
steel plates.
・Do not put any harness on top, underside or outer side of chassis frame members because
someone may step on it or flying gravels may damage it.
・When the Corrugated tube and the air tube vibrate while interfering, the air tube will damage.
Arrange the tube maintaining enough space.
・If there are factory-installed harnesses nearby, secure additional harness on them with tapes
or nylon clips. Do not tape wrap an additional harness directly on a metal pipe or a rubber
hose including the brake pipe and the fuel pipe.
・Provide sufficient clearance between such pipe, hose and a harness.
Positional relation Clearance between harness and pipe/hose
Parallel 10mm or more
Intersecting 20mm or more
Harness routing (2)
Harness routing of near the pipe/hose
Distance between harness and pipe/hose
Parallel: 10mm at min.
Intersecting: 20mm at min.
