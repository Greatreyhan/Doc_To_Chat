MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
・How to extract power from the positive battery terminal
- Provide a fuse in each power extraction circuit.
- Fuses must be a minimum of 300mm apart from the battery (volatile gas may come out of
the battery) and protected from water.
- Do not put a fuse directly on the battery body or on the reverse side of the battery cover,
otherwise the battery will be damaged or explode.
- Use the ring terminal to extract from battery, fix it together with battery terminal to prevent
loosening.
- Only one terminal may be added to prevent loosening.
- Do not connect ground circuit of additional power supply with the existing harness.
Connect it with negative terminal of the battery or the frame to which the negative cable is
connected. In addition, replace the existing ground wire with the ones with capacity that
suits the additional load.
- When using a cable of 5mm2 or larger, solder the pressured part of the wire terminal, and
then wrap the area with a heat shrink tubing.
- Extracted power from battery is always energized, does not depend on the state of the key
switch on the chassis. This can cause the battery go flat. Take the necessary measures
such as appending to the caution label or the owner’s manual.
