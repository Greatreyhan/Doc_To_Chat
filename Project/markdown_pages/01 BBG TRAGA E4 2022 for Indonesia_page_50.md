MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
⑤ Lengthening or shortening an electric wire or a cable
・Splicing of battery cable is prohibited. When high current is energized, it may generate heat at
splicing point and cause fire. (Replace it with new cable.)
・When lengthening a wire, splice a new wire with the same section area and color as those of
the wire to be lengthened.
・When splicing a wire (adding a wire to an end of another wire), use specified joint terminals,
soldering or crimping terminal for secure connection.
・Do not splice the wires by only twisting them together.
・For the area where wires may be subject to vibration such as above engine or transmission,
splicing using specified joint terminals or with crimping terminals is recommended rather than
soldering because solder may seep into the inside of the wires, making them harden and lose
flexibility, resulting in separation.
・ When splicing a wire with soldering or crimping terminals, remove burrs and wrap with vinyl
tape to insulate the area. If the insulation is insufficient, it might short or cause vehicle fire.
・When splicing wires with soldering or crimping terminal outside a cab or on the chassis frame
where water proofing is necessary, wrap butyl rubber at splicing point for waterproofing. If the
water proofing is insufficient, the conductor (copper wire) will corrode and lead to
disconnection or conduction defective.
