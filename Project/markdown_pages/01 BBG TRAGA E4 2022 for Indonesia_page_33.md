MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
When reinforcing a chassis frame side member, follow the instructions below to prevent an acute
change in the section modulus and stress concentration due to welding, since it might cause
deform or crack.
3-2 REINFORCING A CHASSIS FRAME SIDE MEMBER
① Reinforcement material
・The reinforcement material should be equivalent to that of side members.
・Thickness and shape of the reinforcement material should be selected according to rear body
mounting and vehicle usage condition.
・Use L-shaped reinforcement material.
・Channel-shaped reinforcement is not recommended.
- It is difficult to match the dimension of a channel-shaped reinforcement with a chassis
frame side member, and difference in shape between a reinforcement and a side member
results in slacking and reinforcing effect.

Poor reinforcement forming makes      
a gap at the upper or the lower part.
