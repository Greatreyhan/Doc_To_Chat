MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
Be cautious of following when electric welding. Welding current may damage electronic devices
installed in a vehicle.
3-4 PRECAUTIONS FOR WELDING
① Before welding
・Turn off a starter key switch.
・Disconnect a negative battery terminal.
・Disconnect all wire harnesses from electronic unit (control unit).
・Cab welding
- Attach the welder’s ground cable to a plated bolt or metallic part of the cab in the vicinity of
welding site. Before securing the ground cable on such a metallic part, peel off the paint on
the area to reveal its base.
・Chassis welding
- Attach the welder’s ground cable to a plated bolt or a chassis frame member in the vicinity
of welding site. Before securing the cable on the chassis frame member, peel off the paint
on the area to reveal its base.
Poor example
Welding current flow direction (Reference)
Welding current does not flow through electronic unit and return to welder.
Welding current flows through  
electrode → cab → electronic unit → battery → welder ground cable
cab ground
and damage the electronic unit.
Good example
