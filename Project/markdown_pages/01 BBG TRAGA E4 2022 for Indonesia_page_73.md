⑦ Laminated glass
・A laminated glass consists of two thermal-bonded glasses between which a polyvinyl butyral
film is sandwiched. In hot and humid conditions during paint drying, follow the instructions
below. Failure to follow these instructions may result in problems such as peeling of the
polyvinyl butyral film and bubbles between the glasses.
Location of the print on a laminated glass 
- When conducting forced infrared drying, work limit within 30 minutes at temperature no
higher than 80℃.
- If the temperature during such forced drying inevitably exceeds 70℃, before starting the
forced drying, cover the glass to prevent the temperature of the glass surface from
exceeding 70℃, or remove it.
- Laminated glasses can be identified by “LP”, “LS”, “L”, “AS1” or “LAMINATE” printed at the
lower left corner.
