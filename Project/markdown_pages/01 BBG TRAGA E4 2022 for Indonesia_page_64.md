MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
⑩ Wire color and size
Every wire is covered with insulation material with specific color code. The main wires used for
systems are in solid color ① while the sub wires are with stripe ②.
・Use the JIS-certified electric wires for automobiles, or equivalent
- For common area: AV (Low-voltage wire for automobile) or AVS (Thin-walled low-voltage
wire for automobile)
- For high temperature area: AVX (Cross-linked vinyl insulated heat resistant low-voltage
wire for automobile) or AEX (Cross-linked polyethylene
insulated heat resistant low-voltage wire for automobile)

Color code of wire harness
- Adhesive clips should be used only as supplemental parts. (Do not use at places with
relative displacement or vibration)
- Especially, in such a place like the engine room where ambient temperature is high, use
vinyl- or rubber-coated plate clips or band clips. Do not use non-heat-proof vinyl tape or
adhesive clips to bind additional harnesses to the factory-installed harnesses because
they will come unstuck due to heat aging.
- Seal with grommet so the water dripping along the wire does not enter the case, and route
the harness so the terminals become higher than the harness entrance. Consider that
water from tire splash or at cleaning does not enter.
