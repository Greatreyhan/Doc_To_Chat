MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
③ Ground circuit
Careless modification may result in fire or equipment breakdown.
Relocating the ground points of the factory-installed ground circuit and lengthening or
shortening these wires or cables is prohibited, because doing any of these may result in
breakdown of electrical equipments or electronics devices due to surge, etc.
Follow the below instructions when adding ground circuit for bodies or additional equipments.
・How to connect the ground circuit to a chassis frame
- The frame ground point of an additional equipment should be connected to the chassis
frame member to which the negative battery cable is connected.
- Do not secure the ground circuit of additional equipment together with a factory installed
ground point because the fixing bolt will loosen and contact failure will occur.
- Use ring terminal and secure it without looseness. Jamming foreign substance at
connecting will be a cause of looseness.
- Bolt for fixing ground circuit on frame and cab panel is exclusive use. When the bolt is
damaged at work, replace it with specified exclusive ground bolt.
- Weld a mating nut on the chassis frame or directly tap the chassis frame. To drill holes for
directly tapping chassis frame, follow "3-1 DRILLING OR WELDING A CHASSIS FRAME".
