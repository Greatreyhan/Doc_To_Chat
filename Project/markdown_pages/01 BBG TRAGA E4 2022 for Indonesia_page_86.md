REAR BODY MOUNTING 
① Partial load and concentrated load
・When generation of partial load and concentric load in chassis frame is assumed due to
structure of rear body or users loading, distribute the load by adding sub frame or main sill
structure to prevent the transformation and the crack of chassis frame.
・When load is assumed to be concentrated partially such as at cab back crane, add
reinforcements as needed to reduce stress.
・When installing a sub frame, allot the generated bend stress by calculating the combination
beam. When installing reinforcement, do calculation same as the combination beam.
4-1 CONSIDERATION TO PROPER LOAD
Light duty
Flat bed, van, etc. 58 {5.9} or less
Tipper, mixer, garbage, etc. 40 {4.1} or less
Condition of frame tensile 
strength 400 {41} or more
Unit：MPa {kgf/mm2 }
Rear body type Load tendency
Construction equipment carrier Load concentrate on one part depending to the construction machine 
mounted.
Lengthy cargo carrier When the shipment exceed in front or rearward, the load concentrates 
on front axles or rear over hang.
Garbage Load concentrates on rear over hang for hopper weight. Further more, 
the load concentrates on tare meter load cell installation part.
Aerial work platform
Earth auger Load concentrates in front (cab back) part for bucket/boom weight.
Concrete mixer Load concentrates on front and rear drum support.
・Chassis frame is designed assuming uniformly distributed load. Frame stress may become
maximum other than maximum load due to rear body feature, shipment, or rear body
characteristics. Built suitable sub-frame or add reinforcement so the frame stress do not
exceed limits referring to below examples.
② Stress of chassis frame
・Upper limit of the vehicle weight at the time of rear body installing examination is GVW.  
Chassis  frame stress should follow the below. As for GVW details, refer to "1-1PRINCIPAL 
SPECIFICATIONS OF THE CAB CHASSIS".
