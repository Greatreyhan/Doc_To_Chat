⑥ Repairment of damaged wires
・For repairing damaged wires, cutoff the damaged portion, add wire, and perform splicing.
- Below figure shows joint terminal method. Follow the same procedure for solder or
crimped-type terminal method.
- When using specific joint terminal for splicing, the length of wire cutoff and added must be
the same (L mm).
- When splicing with soldering or using crimping terminal, length of the additional wire must
be the total of length of wire cutoff and overlap of joint potion (2 places) added. If there is
recommended length for used crimping terminal, add the overlap length (2 places) to it.
Splicing wires (joint terminal method)
・When rerouting the damaged circuit due to working space etc., follow the above directions
except for the additional wire length.
- For the rerouted wires, perform damage prevention treatment.
