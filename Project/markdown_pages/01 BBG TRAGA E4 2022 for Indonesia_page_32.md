・Length of a weld should be 30 to 50mm, and welds should be spaced a minimum of 40mm.
・Be sure that weld beads do not protrude over holes. Welding should be done away from the
edge of holes by 25mm or more.
・When making a notch by using gas, finish the cut surface by grinding.
・Apply rust proofing after drilling hole, making notch or welding.
③ Other cautions at work
・For pipe type, hole drilling and notch making are prohibited. Attach the parts by welding.
