Chapter 3
MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
・Do not attach the ground cable to a chassis spring, otherwise the spring may break.
・Remove the paint coating and dry the area where welding is to be performed.
・To prevent the following components from being damaged by welding spatters or heat, cover
them up or temporarily relocate them to somewhere reasonably distant. In particular, if
welding any area within 200mm from a fuel tank, remove the fuel tank beforehand.
- Plastic parts - Rubber parts - Electric harnesses
- Air intake duct - Radiator hose - Radiator
- Intercooler - Pipes - Chassis springs
- Tire
・To minimize impact of heat on peripheral area and to assure welding quality, select a suitable
welding torch and perform welding at suitable welding conditions.
・No weld defect such as undercuts, overlaps, and pin holes.
② After welding
・Welded area must not be rapidly cooled.
・Apply rust-proof paint with the same color, if the paint is removed from chassis frame or cab.
・After welding, put the disconnected electronic units such as control unit connectors and fuses
back in place exactly as before. After that, connect negative battery terminal securely.
・Check operation of equipments. Contact ISUZU distributor or ISUZU dealership for checking
method.
・ Use welding electrode depending on parts in following chart.
