MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
When relocating or adding a fuel tank is necessary, follow the local regulations.
When installing an additional fuel tank, be sure that the total amount of fuel does not exceed the
regulation.
3-5 RELOCATION AND ADDITION OF A FUEL TANK
① Location of a fuel tank
・Place a fuel tank somewhere between wheelbase. Do not place it in rear overhang area.
・When lowering the position of the fuel tank, carefully determine the ground height of a fuel
tank not to contact the ground with particular attention to the conditions of use.
・Be sure that the breather opening of the relocated fuel tank will not be subjected to water.
Refer to “⑥ Breather hose" for cautions on breather.
・Maintain sufficient clearances between the hoses for a fuel tank ("A" in the figure below) and
the object to be mounted on a chassis frame such as sub frame, U-bolt and double ended
bracket. If contact is anticipated, wrap the hoses with corrugated tubes or protectors.
・Be sure that the relocated tank is sufficiently apart from any movable or projecting object.
・The fill opening of a fuel tank should be easily accessible so that its cap can be removed or
attached and fuel can be fed without problems.
・Maintain a reasonable clearance between an exhaust system component (front pipe, silencer
and tail pipe) and a fuel tank or a fuel hose.
