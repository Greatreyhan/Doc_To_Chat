Chapter 3
MODIFICATION OF CHASSIS
・If there is any extraneous substance on a bonding surface(cab, panel) such as water, oil and
dust, emblems will not firmly stick to the surface. If there is any, wipe them off completely with
a clean cloth soaked in IPA (isopropyl alcohol). Remove wax if the wax has adhered.
・The ideal ambient temperature for adhesion is 30℃ to 50℃. Make the temperature of the
bonding surface fall within this temperature range.
・Follow the below instructions when using an organic solvent.
- Work in an airy place.
- Fire strictly prohibited.
- Be careful do not get into eyes.
- Stop working immediately when the physical condition worsens.
- Follow instructions of the organic solvent used in detail.

② Precautions before affixing emblems
③ Precautions at affixing emblems
・Use the new article for the emblem.（Part number：897510-1360）
Part numbers may be changed without notice due to specification change, etc. Contact 
ISUZU distributor or ISUZU dealership when ordering.
・As for affixing emblem, set the alignment that came with a chassis on the front lid of a cab,
and then stick each letter sticker by using cut-outs of the alignment as a guide.
・The sticky side of emblem requires pressurization for bonding. To firmly stick the stickers,
apply sufficient and uniform pressure on the emblem. Use of a roller is recommended as they
provide uniform pressurization. The pressure of the roller should be no less than 49N(5kgf/㎟).
・Exposing the sticky side of emblem to the air for long hours weakens their adhesivity due to
adhesion of dust, etc. To protect the sticky side, do not remove a release-paper until
immediately before use.
・Since this sticky-side has very strong adhesive property, once emblems are affixed, peeling
them off is not easy. Before sticking them, carefully check sticking position.
The emblem of the ISUZU mark is affixed to the cab front panel at the vehicle shipment. When
peeling and reattaching of emblem occur in painting and others, follow the instructions below.
・How to peel off a emblem
- Lift the edge of the emblem with a spatula, and pull the emblem slowly and carefully to
peel off it.
- Wipe with toluene to remove remaining adhesive agent on a bonding surface.
- Wipe again with IPA (isopropyl alcohol) after it dry, and wipe with waste cloth at the last.
